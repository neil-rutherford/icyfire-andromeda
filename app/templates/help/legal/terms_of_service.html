We take no responsibility for and we do not expressly or implicitly endorse, support, or guarantee the completeness, truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any of Your Content.</p>
    <p>By submitting Your Content to the Services, you represent and warrant that you have all rights, power, and authority necessary to grant the rights to Your Content contained within these Terms.

    <p>When Your Content is created with or submitted to the Services, you grant us a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, transferable, and sublicensable license to use, copy, modify, adapt, prepare derivative works of, distribute, store, perform, and display Your Content and any name, username, voice, or likeness provided in connection with Your Content in all media formats and channels now known or later developed anywhere in the world. This license includes the right for us to make Your Content available for syndication, broadcast, distribution, or publication by other companies, organizations, or individuals who partner with Galatea. You also agree that we may remove metadata associated with Your Content, and you irrevocably waive any claims and assertions of moral rights or attribution with respect to Your Content.</p>
    <p>Any ideas, suggestions, and feedback about Galatea or our Services that you provide to us are entirely voluntary, and you agree that we may use such ideas, suggestions, and feedback without compensation or obligation to you.</p>
    <p>Although we have no obligation to screen, edit, or monitor Your Content, we may, in our sole discretion, delete or remove Your Content at any time and for any reason, including for violating these Terms, violating our <a href="{{ url_for('help.content_policy') }}">Content Policy</a>, or if you otherwise create or are likely to create liability for us.</p>

If you believe that anything on our Services infringes a copyright or a trademark that you own or control, you may notify Galatea by contacting us at copyright@galatea.com.</p>

    <hr>
    <h2 class="text-center">8. Paid Services and Payment Information</h2>
    <p>There are no fees for the use of many aspects of the Services. However, some services, including Galatea Patriot and Premium API tiers, may be available for purchase (“Paid Services”). In addition to these Terms, by subscribing to Galatea Patriot or Premium API tiers, you further agree to the terms laid out later in this section.</p>
    <p>Galatea may change the fees or benefits associated with the Paid Services from time to time with reasonable advance notice of material changes; provided, however, that no advance notice will be required for temporary promotions, including temporary reductions in the fees associated with the Paid Services.</p>
    <p>You may submit your debit card, credit card, or other payment information (“Payment Information”) via our Services to purchase the Paid Services. We use third-party service providers to process your Payment Information. If you submit your Payment Information, you agree to pay all costs that you incur, and you give us permission to charge you when payment is due for an amount that includes these costs and any applicable taxes and fees.</p>
    <h3 class="text-center">Galatea Patriot and Premium API Tiers</h3>
    <p>Galatea Patriot and Premium API are subscription membership. When you purchase Galatea Patriot or Premium API, you expressly agree that you are authorizing recurring payments, and that payments will be made to Galatea by the payment method and at the recurring intervals you have agreed to, until the subscription is canceled by you or by Galatea.</p>
    <p>You can manage your Galatea Patriot and/or Premium API subscription and Payment Information by accessing your Account’s user settings. We automatically process your Payment Information on the calendar day corresponding to the start of your subscription. If your subscription starts on a day not contained in the next month, you will be billed on the last day of that month. Mobile renewal processing dates may vary by up to 3 days. If your Payment Information is declined, you must provide new Payment Information or your subscription will be canceled. If you provide new Payment Information and are successfully charged, your new subscription period will be based on the original renewal date and not the date of the successful charge.</p>
    <p>You can cancel Galatea Patriot and Premium API any time. Your subscription automatically renews unless you cancel at least 24 hours before your subscription period ends. To cancel your subscription, follow the instructions in your Account’s user settings. Your subscription will remain active from the time you cancel until the start of the next billing period, and you will not receive a refund or credit for any remaining days in your current billing period.</p>
    <h3 class="text-center">Virtual Goods</h3>
    <p>Virtual Goods are virtual currency or items, including coins. These Virtual Goods may not be purchased, but may be earned by interacting with Galatea. Users have no property, proprietary, intellectual property, ownership, or monetary interest in promotional or purchased Virtual Goods, which remain Galatea digital content subject to these Terms. Virtual Goods are transferable between Accounts (provided the transfer occurs using approved Galatea channels), and can be exchanged for subscription time. Virtual Goods transfered to other users will not be returned (e.g., if you transfer coins to another user, you cannot take the Virtual Goods back).</p>
    <p>Galatea may modify its Virtual Goods at its sole discretion, and such modifications may make some or all Virtual Goods more or less common, desirable, effective, or functional. The relative value of Virtual Goods may be increased or decreased, any Virtual Good may be withdrawn, and restrictions on any Virtual Good redemption may be imposed at any time, even though such changes may affect the value or utility of the Virtual Good, or the ability to obtain certain Virtual Goods.</p>
    <p>Galatea does not guarantee that the Virtual Goods will continually be offered for any particular length of time. Galatea may modify, suspend, or terminate Virtual Goods for any or no reason, in its sole discretion, and without advance notice or liability. In accumulating Virtual Goods, users may not rely upon the continued availability of any Virtual Goods.</p>
    <h3 class="text-center">No Refunds</h3>
    <p>As stated in the User Agreement and Content Policy, you must follow and comply with the rules of the platform. Failure to do so may result in a temporary or permanent ban from Galatea or the removal of certain Virtual Goods. In such instances, you might lose the benefits of paid subscriptions and/or Virtual Goods. There are no refunds.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2 class="text-center">9. Indemnity</h2>
    <p>Except to the extent prohibited by law, you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold us, our directors, officers, employees, affiliates, agents, contractors, third-party service providers, and licensors (the "Galatea Entities") harmless from any claim or demand, including costs and attorneys’ fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of (a) your use of the Services, (b) your violation of these Terms, (c) your violation of applicable laws or regulations, or (d) Your Content.
