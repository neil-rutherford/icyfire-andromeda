    <h1 class="text-center">Reset my password</h1>
    <p>At some point, you may need to change your password. Your account may have been hacked, or you may have just forgotten it! (It happens to the best of us.) To change your password, you need to have access to the email account that was used to create your Galatea account.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Click the blue <a href="{{ url_for('auth.login') }}"><button class="btn btn-outline-primary"><b>Log In</b></button></a> in the top-right corner of the navigation bar.</li>
        <li>On the login page, click on the blue <a href="{{ url_for('auth.reset_password_request') }}">Forgot your password?</a> link under the password field.</li>
        <li>You will be asked for one piece of information: the email address used to set up the Galatea account. If you no longer have access to this email, consider <a href="{{ url_for('help.help_topic', topic='account', title='create_account') }}">creating a new account</a>.</li>
        <li>Once you have entered your email address, click the blue "Request password reset >>" button.</li>
        <li>Check your email inbox. Galatea will send you an email with the subject "Reset your password". If you don't see the email in your inbox, check your junk email folder.</li>
        <li>Open the email and click the link as instructed. The link is only valid for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Choose a new password and enter it twice (once into the "Password" field, once into the "Verify password" field). Click the blue <button class="btn btn-primary">Reset password >></button> button when you are finished.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If the password reset is successful, you will see a message saying "Your password has been reset." and you will be redirected to the login page.</p>
