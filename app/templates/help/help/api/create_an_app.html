    <p>Before you may begin using the Galatea API, you must first register an app. To do this, go to the <a href="{{ url_for('api.apply') }}">"Apply for API permissions"</a> page and fill out the form. The information you provide will help us guide you through the process. If we find that you have been untruthful in your application, we reserve the right to adjust your permissions as we see fit.</p>

    <p>After you submit your application, your app will go into a review stage and you will receive a response within 3 business days. You may <a href="{{ url_for('api.view_client') }}">check on the status of your app here</a>. If reviewers have any questions, they will communicate with you via the email you provided. If you have applied for escalated permissions, <a href="{{ url_for('payment.buy_premium_api') }}">subscribe to the Premium API Tier</a> as soon as possible so that your application is not hindered.</p>
